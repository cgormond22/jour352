        <h3><b>What is Cancel Culture?</b></h3>
        Cancel culture has become the internet’s policing system throughout the past few years and users have mixed
        feelings about it. According to the Pew Research Center, “The phrase ‘cancel culture’ is said to have originated
        from a relatively obscure slang term – ‘cancel,’ referring to breaking up with someone – used in a 1980s song.”
        Nowadays, “breaking up with” online influencers has become a widespread practice.

        If you have witnessed your favorite influencer’s follower count quickly decline or viewed an “apology video,”
        aimed at addressing a controversy surrounding them, you’ve likely encountered cancel culture.

        <h3><b>Urban Outfitters</b></h3>
        The cancellation of the clothing store, Urban Outfitters, is an example of a wide-scale cancellation. In the
        wake of the death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter Movement, many companies were making statements of
        anti-racism and voicing their support for the black community. Urban Outfitters’s controversial past began to
        come to light, with reports of racism among staff, underrepresentation of minorities and a history of producing
        offensive items of clothing. In a public statement, the company apologized to any employees or customers who
        felt offended or uncomfortable in their stores.

        <h3><b>Shane Dawson</b></h3>
        Shane Dawson was once one of the most popular YouTubers, famous for his conspiracy theory videos, and loved by
        his
        millions of followers. However, the majority of younger generations could recall the infamous cancellation of
        Dawson. His downfall began when he posted a video making inappropriate gestures at a poster of then-11-year-old
        Willow Smith. Many who felt uncomfortable with this video, began digging into his past and found a plethora of
        “cancelable” content including problematic and offensive jokes, and even Dawson wearing blackface. Although he
        posted an apology video, attempting to dig himself out of the hole he was in, many of his past followers were
        not convinced. According to the Independent, days after releasing the apology video on June 28, 2020, Dawson
        lost more than 700,000 subscribers. Just over one week later, his subscriber count dropped by more than one
        million from 23.1 million to 22.1 million.

        <h3><b>Ellen DeGeneres</b></h3>
        Ellen DeGeneres is another public figure who went through a major cancellation in recent years. After a tweet in
        2020 generated thousands of responses with stories of toxic environments while working for DeGeneres, the
        situation began to be investigated. <i>Variety</i> later published a report that crew members on “The Ellen
        DeGeneres
        Show” were “distressed and outraged” over treatment from top producers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many
        reported that DeGeneres was an extremely harsh boss and was “demeaning” towards her coworkers. Although she
        issued many apologies, her talk show lost a significant amount of viewers in the following weeks, with a 43%
        decline, according to <i>The New York Times</i>. She later announced the permanent end to the nineteen-year-long
        show.

        <h3><b>Is it Helpful or Hurtful?</b></h3>
        Cancel culture has remained a controversial topic, with some believing that it is necessary to hold people
        accountable over the internet, and some believing that it serves as a way to hinder free speech and may lead to
        the spread of hate. The Pew Research Center cited many anonymous sources’ opinions on both sides of the
        spectrum. Accoridng to Pew, "Overall, 58% of U.S. adults say in general, calling out others on social media is
        more likely to hold people accountable, while 38% say it is more likely to punish people who don’t deserve it."

        <h3><b>Has the Public Adjusted to Cancel Culture?</b></h3>
        Cancel Culture has taught many users of social media apps that a digital footprint can truly last a lifetime. In
        numerous instances, including some highlighted in this article, public figures have been "canceled" for actions
        or comments made years earlier. This emphasizes the importance of exercising caution with online posts at all
        times. Despite this, <i>Data For Progress</i> has found that cancel culture has not largely affected the way
        that users behave online.

        <h3><b>Moving Forward</b></h3>
        As cancel culture continues to evolve, these questions about accountability, forgiveness, and the permanence of
        a digital footprint become more prevalent in society. As we have seen many believe it serves as a way to hold
        public figures and organizations accountable for harmful behavior. In contrast, others express concern that it
        may limit free speech, encourage a mob mentality, or spread negativity.
        What remains evident is that cancel culture will not disappear at any time soon. We must ensure that online
        discourse fosters constructive dialogue and mutual understanding.
